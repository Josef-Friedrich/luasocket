---To obtain the `socket` namespace, run:
---
---```lua
----- loads the socket module

---Creates and returns a clean

---
---Note: This idea saved a lotof work with the

---
---```lua
---foo = socket.protect(function()
---    -- connect somewhere

function socket.protect(func) end

---
---Waits for a number of sockets to change status.
---
--- `Recvt` and `sendt` can also
---be empty tables or `nil`. Non-socket values (or values with
---non-numeric indices) in the arrays will be silently ignored.
---
---The function returns a list with the sockets ready for
---reading, a list with the sockets ready for writing and an error message.
---The error message is "`timeout`" if a timeout
---condition was met, "`select failed`" if the call
---to `select` failed, and
---`nil` otherwise. The returned tables are
---doubly keyed both by integers and also by the sockets
---themselves, to simplify the test if a specific socket has
---changed status.
---
---Note:`select` can monitor a limited number
---of sockets, as defined by the constant
---`socket._SETSIZE`. This
---number may be as high as 1024 or as low as 64 by default,
---depending on the system. It is usually possible to change this
---at compile time. Invoking `select` with a larger
---number of sockets will raise an error.
---
---Important note: a known bug in WinSock causes `select` to fail
---on non-blocking TCP sockets. The function may return a socket as
---writable even though the socket is notready for sending.
---
---Another important note: calling select with a server socket in the receive parameter before a call to accept does notguarantee
---`accept`will return immediately.
---Use the `settimeout`
---method or `accept` might block forever.
---
---Yet another note: If you close a socket and pass
---it to `select`, it will be ignored.
---
---Using select with non-socket objects: Any object that implements `getfd` and `dirty` can be used with `select`, allowing objects from other libraries to be used within a `socket.select` driven loop.
---
---@param recvt table|nil # `recvt` is an array with the sockets to test for characters available for reading.
---@param sendt table|nil # Sockets in the `sendt` array are watched to see if it is OK to immediately write on them.
---@param timeout? integer # `timeout` is the
---maximum amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a change in status.  A
---`nil`, negative or omitted `timeout` value allows the
---function to block indefinitely.

---Waits for a remote connection on the server object and returns a client object representing that connection.
---
---If a connection is successfully initiated, a client object is returned. If a timeout condition is met, the method returns `nil` followed by the error string 'timeout'. Other errors are reported by `nil` followed by a message describing the error.
---
---Note: calling `socket.select` with a server object in the recvt parameter before a call to accept does not guarantee accept will return immediately. Use the `settimeout` method or accept might block until another client shows up.

---
---Binds a master object to address and port on the local host.
---
---Address can be an IP address or a host name. Port must be an integer number in the range [0..64K). If address is `'*'`, the system binds to all local interfaces using the `INADDR_ANY` constant or `IN6ADDR_ANY_INIT`, according to the family. If `port` is `0`, the system automatically chooses an ephemeral port.
---
---In case of success, the method returns `1`. In case of error, the method returns `nil` followed by an error message.
---
---On success, the type changes to `TCPSocketServer`, and you should cast it as such.

---Closes a TCP object.
---The internal socket used by the object is closed and the local address to which the object was bound is made available to other applications.
---No further operations (except for further calls to the close method) are allowed on a closed socket.
---
---Note: It is important to close all used sockets once they are not needed, since, in many systems,
---each socket uses a file descriptor, which are limited system resources.
---Garbage-collected objects are automatically closed before destruction, though.
function tcp_master:close() end

---
---Attempts to connect a master object to a remote host, transforming it into a client object.
---Client objects support methods `send`, `receive`, `getsockname`, `getpeername`, `settimeout`, and `close`.
---
---On success, the type changes to `TCPClient`, and you should cast it as such.
---
---Note: The function `socket.connect` is available and is a shortcut for the creation of client sockets.
---Note: Starting with LuaSocket 2.0, the `settimeout` method affects the behavior of connect, causing it to return with an error in case of a timeout. If that happens, you can still call socket.select with the socket in the sendt table. The socket will be writable when the connection is established.
---Note: Starting with LuaSocket 3.0, the host name resolution depends on whether the socket was created by socket.tcp, socket.tcp4 or socket.tcp6. Addresses from the appropriate family (or both) are tried in the order returned by the resolver until the first success or until the last failure. If the timeout was set to zero, only the first address is tried.

---@alias TCPOption
---| "keepalive" Setting this option to `true` enables the periodic transmission of messages on a connected socket. Should the connected party fail to respond to these messages, the connection is considered broken and processes using the socket are notified;
---| "linger" Controls the action taken when unsent data are queued on a socket and a close is performed. The value is a table with a boolean entry `on` and a numeric entry for the time interval `timeout` in seconds. If the `on` field is set to `true`, the system will block the process on the close attempt until it is able to transmit the data or until `timeout` has passed. If `on` is `false` and a `close` is issued, the system will process the `close` in a manner that allows the process to continue as quickly as possible. I do not advise you to set this to anything other than zero;

---
---Reads data from a client object, according to the specified read pattern. Patterns follow the Lua file I/O format, and the difference in performance between all patterns is negligible.
---
---**Important note:** This function was changed severely. It used to support multiple patterns (but I have never seen this feature used) and now it doesn't anymore. Partial results used to be returned in the same way as successful results. This last feature violated the idea that all functions should return nil on error. Thus it was changed too.

---@alias TCPTimeoutMode
---| "b" block timeout. Specifies the upper limit on the amount of time LuaSocket can be blocked by the operating system while waiting for completion of any single I/O operation.
---| "t" total timeout. Specifies the upper limit on the amount of time LuaSocket can block a Lua script before returning from a call.

---
---Changes the timeout values for the object. By default, all I/O operations are blocking. That is, any call to the methods `send`, `receive`, and `accept` will block indefinitely, until the operation completes. The `settimeout` method defines a limit on the amount of time the I/O methods can block. When a timeout is set and the specified amount of time has elapsed, the affected methods give up and fail with an error code.
---
---**Note:** although timeout values have millisecond precision in LuaSocket, large blocks can cause I/O functions not to respect timeout values due to the time the library takes to transfer blocks to and from the OS and to and from the Lua interpreter. Also, function that accept host names and perform automatic name resolution might be blocked by the resolver for longer than the specified timeout value.
---
---**Note:** The old timeout method is deprecated. The name has been changed for sake of uniformity, since all other method names already contained verbs making their imperative nature obvious.
---

---
---Creates and returns an TCP master object. A master object can be transformed into a server object with the method `listen` (after a call to `bind`) or into a client object with the method `connect`. The only other method supported by a master object is the close method.
---
---Note: The choice between IPv4 and IPv6 happens during a call to `bind` or `connect`, depending on the address family obtained from the resolver.
---
---Note: Before the choice between IPv4 and IPv6 happens, the internal socket object is invalid and therefore `setoption` will fail.
